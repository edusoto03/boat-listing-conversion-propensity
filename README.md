# 🛥 Boat Listing Conversion Propensity Model

***Overview***

This project simulates an internal machine learning workflow for predicitng the probability that a boat listing generates a lead (conversion) in a marine markeplace.

The objective of this model is to demonstrate applied data science skills aligned with marketplace analytics, this includes:
- SQL-based dataset construction
- Feature engineering
- Propensity modeling (logistic regression)
- Model evaluation and tradeoff analysis
- Business-driven interpretation

***Problem Definition***
